# Open Hexagon 3

A potential rewrite for Open Hexagon by Vittorio Romeo using Love2D.

*(omg it's finally happening)*

## External dependencies
Apart from the pure lua dependencies that are present in the repository, the game relies on:
- Love2D
- SQLite
- Luv (this one can be installed with luarocks) (lua 5.1 specifically)

## Tests
Run tests with `luajit test/main.lua` in the source directory.
Generate coverage statistics with `luajit test/main.lua --coverage`
